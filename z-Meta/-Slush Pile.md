There’s a rumor about whales; they don’t need to swim. Anything with that much power and gray matter could figure out walking if they wanted to. Rumor among sailors is they’re afraid of something, which is why they ran to the sea.
These tales are told by long-retired sailors, and only in taverns far from the sea. The risk of a whale overhearing is too great shoreside.

Something to do with banks and sins or something. Bank of sins? Can you buy forgiveness? Do they only let you in if you've sinned enough?

Upside down tree. Roots sprout upwards from corpses. Evil tree, makes husks like mass effect

Cave of the Traveler. Spooky cave/dungeon that takes you to other locations. It is both dangerous and unreliable of where you might come out.

Centipede lady. Like a centaur but worse.

Vent drinker. herd animal. lives near dangerous mana vents. Can process mana/chaos energy that would kill anybody else.

Encounter a random dead body in the water. It's packed full of spices and herbs. It is pickling to be eaten later. 

Monkeys worshipping a sword. the sword is magic, epic, and evil.

Bad guy keeps a big gun inside a pillar. Smashes the pillar and pulls out the gun, so the Phase 2 of the fight is him shooting while the room starts collapsing.

Sell your karma. Can get cash in exchange for bad luck. Only extremely poor or desperate people do this.

Oasis with weird water that turns things into monsters.

Pit of god ash from leftover dead relics. People are kicked down there.

Giant ape with long arms and spines (quills). Will bear hug you and runs away. Spines will break off inside you and you get infected/poisoned. Will stalk you like komodo dragons until you are too sick to move and then it eats you.

Tiny little water creatures that hold water in a sac. Filter the salt out of the water so they only hold fresh water. Will cling to people and the heavier fresh water will sink and drown them. Can be captured and used to filter fresh water.

Living island floating raft animals. Kinda like Reefbacks from subnautica except on the surface.

The Other Side. Faerie/shadow realm
 The upside down. Town that exists in two places at once. The Well.

Don't lie to fey. Or at least don't get caught in a lie. If you tell an obvious lie, not only are you trying to trick them, you're implying that they're too stupid to see through it, and that's an insult. You'd be dead before you can blink

"It seems you only speak the language of the sword. Fortunately, I happen to be fluent."

"What is kindness? She taught me. What is trust? She showed me. What is loss? She died for me. I made her sick, and she died in my arms. I gave her life, to bring her back and YOU KILLED HER AGAIN!"

Siege Crab.

Setting is way older than previously thought.
Gods are more powerful too. A god will affect the area it is in. 
War gods makes everything aggressive.
Fertility gods make everything fuck
Gravity god makes weird gravity shit everywhere. Weird pockets of sideways and upside down gravity. People build around/through these, so you get upside down staircases

New biomes:  
Celenia - Atomic bees place
Dundriago - Outside Yog
Mismera - Lunar terrain

There are three kinds of men. Those who have something to live for, those who have something to die for, and those who have something to kill for. You have none of these. You are a ghost, searching for a graveyard.

"Do you really plan on letting anger and revenge decide everything until you reach your goal?
Your current emotions aren't going to burn down just a single tree, but the whole damn forest.
And in the end, you'll also be nothing more than ashes."

Cool stronghold, but it's actually a prison for a really powerful guy.

Potom island incident

**5. PURPLE OGRE**
Tusked purple giant. Covered in black bristles. Loves ugliness and the scent of rotting flesh. Claps its hands over its ears and howls at the sound of poetry.

Keeps its soul in a bottle hanging from a leather thong around its neck. Can't be killed in combat unless the bottle is broken. Severed limbs move autonomously. Likes to pluck off its own still-living head and juggle it.

Can grant the ability to talk to animals, on condition that you die if any human hears you doing it. Will use this to bargain for its bottle back.

Classic group of vampires want to extinguish the sun.

Faction wants to stop them (yes, its Dawnguard with different name. Stfu.)

Cult of the Burning Mind. Very much like The Gamer's church of masks. Big fight, all the heirophant's mooks suddenly collapse, a glowing substance flows into the Heirophant, giving him epic powers. 
"A vampire's mind is that of poison, and has no place amongst us"

Vampire boss flesh mecha. (Like the OATS Firewatch River King) Heirophant fights VB, taking out his mech, leaving party to fight his regular boss form.

Random npc claims vampires are a hoax made by the government 

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAITH AND REASON 

Different types of vampires have different abilities.

Piaro, the Sword Saint:
"Every moment, my mind is poisoned further by the Law of Swords. Every moment wielding the Blade is a moment the toxin sinks deeper. I will not teach you. Only a fool would want to learn the Sword Law, and I do not teach fools.

Kraken. Likes magic, do not cast spells while on the water within its territory or it will find you. 

Ocean Bosses have territory, won't pursue beyond them.

The Kraken comes for the man who bears the black mark. Curse?

THE HARVEST IS ENDING

Cannibal had a tattoo which he has since removed via knife

Werewolf or some big guy who has a giant gun (AA gun or sumn) that he keeps inside a Pillar. Smashes the Pillar and starts blasting as the roof starts falling. Phase 2.

Storage item but:
Vault of Winter: the inside is extremely cold.
Desert Pendant: keeps filling up with hot sand. Will leak sand if it gets too full.


Don't speak the name of the brown one. It will summon him. 
Honey-eater, tree-climber, fish-hunter, man-killer. All are the brown one.
The brown one is a god amongst men: as we do not say the names of the gods, we do not say the name of the brown one.
If you wish to face the gods early, speak the name of the brown one. It will summon him.


Godpacts are the primary way to get magic. It's a contract. you get power, they get faith (and maybe a favour). Magic can be learned though, like if you talk to elementals enough.

Mech touch 3118, 5433, 5436.
Galaxies have agendas.
Too big a scale. Planets? Still too big. Cities works. That's just a zondervose.
Countries perhaps. Zondervoses are kind to those who further their agendas.
YO GODPACTS ARE AN INVESTMENT

Gods/zondervoses are the same.

Galaxies are alive, and have their own agendas. They use their various lifeforms/resources to fight and gain influence over other galaxies.
They favour people who can further their goals.
MW buffed Ves because the system makes it more likely for him to make a difference. 
RO saw that MW favoured him, and took a chance by making him a phase lord, hopefully to avoid Messier's invasion.

Gods make magic, but it's limited. If people use it in a way that isn't conductive to the god's plans, they get pissed.
They are competing against each other, playing the long game.
Small gods are nice, big gods are dicks. This is because they have more options and don't have to be generous or forgiving any more.
What does this mean for godpacts?
A godpact is an investment by a god, in the hopes that the person will further the god's plans.

Beeconomy.
Bees are worth money.
Bees die over time, but a queen bee can keep a population stable.
10k Workers : 100 Drones : 1 Queen
Different tiers of bees.
Common, silver, gold,  diamond, etc
Next tier of bee costs 100x as much as current one. Next drone costs current queen. Some shopkeepers won't accept bees of a kind they have no queen for.

https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2021/11/slush-pile-1121.html?m=1

Big pond that you have to cross. Giant white carp live in it. Giant dead birds float on the surface, there's a bunch piling up in a corner of the pool. You can stand on the pile, for now. A carp will occasionally pull one of the birds under. They'll get you if you try swim across. You gotta close your eyes while you do it (they can see what you see, and can identify your position that way). While you swim (eyes closed), you'll slowly grow scales and fins. Webbed fingers. It's beautiful. 

Tiny little rainbow iridescent sea slug. Nudibranch? That one Pokemon, but moreso. Gastrodon. It can psychically control a humanoid puppet, which looks *exceptionally* real. The puppet is of a cute girl, posing as a tinker. Keeps her real self in a tiny glowing box that's hard to open. Will know as soon as anyone touches it.

This city is a giant ring city with high walls. It is shaped like a donut, with all the farms on the inside. This means that the population can only get so high. That's ok, because they are constantly drafting people to defend the walls from the demons. Because some idiot decided to make a city in the beast lands.
