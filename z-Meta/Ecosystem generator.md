## Plant
FLECHETTE PINE
A pine tree, but its needles are solid, heavy, and sharp. It drops them on anything moving underneath it. It's roots consume the dead body. People hate this bastard tree.

SEA TREE
A thick layer of salt crystals surround a soft, jellylike interior. It absorbs seawater from the ocean, and crystallizes it into its shell in order to grow. The jelly is either a delicacy or a source of water, haven't decided yet.

ANTI-CACTUS
This fucked up plant stabs itself whenever something touches it. Seems to have psychoresonant properties, as creatures invariably feel bad for the plant's misfortune, and so leave it alone. When properly harvested by psychopath gardeners, it is a delicacy in certain circles.

CANOPTIC IVY
Grows along the ground. When it encounters an obstacle (dead animal, brick, tree stump, etc), its leaves will envelop the offending object and harden into a solid shell, before continuing to grow onwards. 
Small children and adventurers like to break these "urns" open to find loot.
