List of different governance structures to chop and drop into different cities.

Faction Advisors:
Several different factions in the city (farmers, builders, military, merchants, etc) each have a representative on the council. They are there to advise the local chosen of the god on what issues need attention.

Venerated Ancestor:
The Penderach lies in a gilded coffin.
Members of the high council gather around the Penderach's corpse, staging elaborate rituals to trick each other into believing the Penderach somehow approves of their agenda.

Tripart Council:
There are three councils that overseer the city. The youth council, the(middle aged) council, and the elder council.
They are divided by age groups, and each council has the same political power. 
A person can only serve on one council in their life. It prevents career politicians from being out of touch with everything, while ensuring that old bastards don't fuck the whole place up for the youth of tomorrow.

Rival Leaders:
A pair of leaders who hate each other are given power. They are chosen for their inability to work together and their innate dislike of each other, and then are forced to spend their lives together as long as they hold the positions of leadership.
They have full power over the govt for a specified set of time. the goal is that, so long as they hate each other, they will work together for the good of the people overall but will act as their own *checks and balances* because they'll do anything to keep the other from gaining more power than themselves.

Destitute Prophets:
The city has a caste system. Your caste is not determined by birth, but by what the prophets decree. The prophet caste determines which caste others are in, and can promote/demote people into higher or lower castes. The prophet caste is the lowest of all castes, living in squalor. Prophets are godpacted to the god of fates. There are other castes that dont fit into the ladder, such as the General caste, where they can command armies, but have no political power outside of the army. This ensures that they don't do stupid political moves and get assasinated, meaning that the best generals stay alive, so the army stays strong.

Accountability from Violence:
Punishment for crimes is relative to the power of the individual who is guilty.
Powerful people are seen as responsible, because those who are irresponsible with their power are held Accountable.
There’s a super powerful person called The Accountant, who deals with people who are irresponsible with their power. The more powerful someone is, the higher standards they are held to. Eg. Regular guy accidentally breaks someone’s arm, he might get a fine. Superman accidentally breaks someone’s arm, massive punishment, because the risk are much much higher. Superman’s capacity for destruction is much higher than Regular guy’s. The punishment is designed to teach superman to be responsible, and incentive for keeping safe. 
The whole system only works because the Accountant doling out the punishments is very powerful indeed. Hell, maybe they’re a robot/golem that is always responsible. Leftover from the Godswar?

Corporatism. NOT to be confused with corporations. Unions are in charge.

Autocracy. Region divided into zones which are all somewhat independant (can supply their own food/power/metal/etc).
