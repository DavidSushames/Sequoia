The Devil's Hole is a great hole in the ground near [[Handasa]] that the nearby river falls into. The constant waterfall makes grip treacherous, and forms a thick mist that obscures vision and puts out torches. Despite these hazards, the people continue to delve, as the supply of ores down there is simply too valuable to go untapped.
Some miners have reported feelings of being watched, but that's probably just nerves. The occasional team that goes missing must have just gotten lost, that's all.

And who knows what foul beasts may be lurking in the depths?
