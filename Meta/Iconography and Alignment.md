# Freedom
Freedom means shaping your own destiny.
Freedom is fluidity.
Freedom carries memories of structure.
Freedom is not just movement, but choosing **when** to move.
Freedom is not just survival, but survival **anywhere**, through cleverness and adaptation.
Freedom means having options.
#### Metalworking
*We take the spirits of the land and fashion our own gods of iron.*
Metalworking and Invention are seen as rebellion against the old ways. Taking something raw and reshaping it into something new. Industrialists believe in this deeply, while wizards find it heretical.
#### Water
Water-caravans, floating settlements, and vast canal networks allow societies to stay in motion.
A symbol of movement, adaptability, and untamed expansion. The industrialists build floating factories and river-trains that carve new paths into the wild.
Water does not hold form. It flows, carves new paths, and always finds a way forward. It is movement, resistance, and adaptability.
#### Spring
*This is a new thing. Everything is fresh and growing, but the ghost of winter lingers.* 
The season of renewal and rebellion. The old time is over, it's time for something new. 
Many new projects start in spring. _A new track laid, a new engine tested, a new frontier claimed._
#### Lizards
*Use what you can. Don’t be afraid to cut and run. Shed what no longer serves you.*
Some people breed lizards for use in construction or as living siege weapons.
Those who can't change will be left behind.
Shedding skin is a **ritual of renewal**. Some people shave their heads after a major life change.
“You’re carrying dead skin” is an insult suggesting that they are stuck in old ways, refusing to grow.
#### Lichen
Lichen is a living symbol of perseverance. It thrives in the harshest places, spreading without permission. Just like lichen, we can spread and live anywhere, regardless of the conditions.
If Permanence is a tree, Freedom is the stubborn, creeping lichen that refuses to be tamed.
#### Sun
*The sun doesn't care if you are not ready. It rises, and you must keep up or be left in the dark.*
A beacon of endless potential. Industrialists often depict the sun as a rising force, symbolizing unstoppable progress. *To harness fire and light is to claim the future.*
Those who embrace Freedom revere the daylight. It is a reminder to keep moving before darkness (and stagnation) catches up.
The sun is a beacon that guides us home. It's always in the same place, so you can't ever get lost.
# Permanence
Permanence means keeping your word.
Permanence is being remembered.
Permanence is having enough food.
Permanence is about conservation and sustainability.
Permanence is about preservation.
#### Swearing Oaths
Oaths are binding. A man without his word is nothing. Oaths are like termination clauses. 
An oath is a piece of your soul, nailed to the world itself. "I swear upon ten years of service."
Some cultures mark their oaths on their bodies in tattoos or brands.
Oaths must be staked on something important, breaking them takes that thing away.
“What did you swear on?” is a common question when testing loyalty.
#### Fame
*Your name is an unshakable monument. 
To be known is to be remembered. To be remembered is to be immortal.*
 If you carve your name into history, you will live long after your death.
The worst fate is to fade into obscurity. Erasing someone from history is worse than killing them.
#### Eating
*Food is power. Those who do not eat do not last.*
The body is sustained through nourishment. Eating is a ritual, an act that binds the eater to the world, reinforcing the permanence of the self. 
Food is sacred. Wasting food is to insult the world itself. 
Feasts are acts of permanence that tie families together, cement alliances, and honour ancestors.
#### Undead
*Look at the oathbreaker! See how he toils, unable to stop, rest, or die. Keep your word, children.*
Death is not an end. Some cultures venerate undead as eternal keepers of wisdom. Others use undeath to bind criminals in eternal servitude.
Some people refuse to pass on, bound by duty, revenge, or an unfulfilled oath.
People believe the strongest wills refuse death itself.
#### Healing
*To heal is to restore what was lost.*
Healing isn’t just medicine, it’s restoring what was lost. Nothing should be forgotten or abandoned.
Preservation over transformation. Some healers refuse to let wounds alter a body, striving to keep people unchanged. Scars aren't cool; what is broken must be restored.
#### Winter
*Cold, preservation, conservation, and status quo.*
A season of waiting, remembering, and preparing.
A time of reckoning, where only the strongest traditions and bloodlines remain.
The past is never truly buried: Winter preserves both food and grudges.
# Knowledge
Knowledge requires the will to do what must be done.
Knowledge takes nature's gifts and makes them our own.
Knowledge is mastery over the unknown.
Knowledge is not power, but knowing how to use it is.
Knowledge is having a big fucking dog to maul people for you.
#### Persistence
*Life doesn't die on command. It bites, howls, claws, and kicks until the last beat of the heart.*
The world is a cruel place. You have to be worse. Do whatever it takes to bring this world to heel.
They are known for their unyielding resilience, and refuse to back down in the face of adversity.
A broken tool is still a tool. If something can still function, it is not useless.
Survival is the art of adaptation. They learn, adjust, and find new ways to keep going.
#### Fire
A raging force of nature, now tamed by Knowledge to cook food, smelt metal, and light the way. Some cultures see the act of lighting a fire as a declaration of dominance over the wild.
Fire requires control. Tame fire warms homes and cooks food, but wild fire destroys towns. 
Fire burns away ignorance and weakness.
#### Ships
Control over the seas is mastery over nature. Move across nature without being part of it.
Navigating the world is a form of mastery over the unknown. With every sea crossed and every shore charted, the Knowledge of the world increases.
Knowledge is meant to move. It's not enough to have knowledge, you have to spread it.
#### Murdering
Knowledge is power. Some societies teach assassination as an intellectual pursuit; a test of wit and understanding rather than mere brutality. We cannot match Nature's raw might, so we must overcome it in other ways. No amount of muscle can stop a knife between the ribs.
Inquisitors and shadowy scholars. Some knowledge is too dangerous. Secrets are worth killing for.
Murder is not just an act of violence, it is a decision. It is knowing exactly what must be done and doing it without hesitation.
#### Silver
Silver on its own is useless. It is a soft metal, weak in battle. Its true value lies in what it enables. 
Silvered weapons are not stronger, but let you kill what should be unkillable.
There's not a lot that a man won't do, for enough silver. 
Also it channels power better than anything else.
#### Dogs
*The world is flawed. Take what nature gives you and perfect it.*
Once a proud symbol of nature, the beast lurking in the dark. Now our most loyal companions. 
Dogs are symbols of loyalty, civilization, and the ability to tame the world.
The best dogs are trained, not wild. Knowledge can refine even the rawest materials.
Some cultures have giant war dogs. Riding dogs. 
# Nature
Nature is being armed and dangerous. 
Nature is being huge.
Nature dwells in the dark places.
Nature is being unknowable.
Nature is adapting unseen.
Nature is eating your friends
#### Knives
*To hesitate with a knife is to die unprepared.*
Everything in nature carries a knife, whether it is claws, horns, teeth, hooves, or poison. Nature has no mercy, survival is not gentle.
Everybody carries a weapon. The right to bear arms shall not be infringed.
#### Giants
Giant animals, giant trees, giant armies. Nature reveres size. It says go big or go home. And so it has champions.
Bodies without souls are bigger and stronger. Archdruids have removed their souls, and are forces of nature on the battlefield.
#### Darkness
*Tigers aren't scared of the dark. They know there's nothing in the dark that's scarier than a tiger.*
Darkness is the unknown. Some see it as a place of safety, away from the reach of Knowledge.
It's not a place of evil, but of uncivilization. The world is not meant to be understood in full.
Some believe that darkness should be left that way; lights at night time are not allowed.
Darkness is not evil, just vast and indifferent.
#### Octopuses
Creatures of mystery. The mind without order. Intelligence beyond knowledge. 
Octopi represent the alien, the unknowable, the organic intelligence that defies categorization.
Octopi are adaptable, and so followers of Nature should be too. Life finds a way.
Octopi are weird. Lots of limbs, no bones, squirting ink. Some nature followers are equally weird, trying to imitate octopi in a similar manner.
#### Toads
Toads emphasize patience, resilience, lurking danger, and unseen transformation. They thrive in overlooked places and are often linked to strange wisdom, poison, and metamorphosis.
Toads lurk in the mud and filth, thriving where others falter. They have always been there, watching.
There's totally an underground civilization of nature followers that nobody knows/cares/pretends to know about. Legally distinct from Skaven, please don't sue.  
#### Cannibalizing
_Nothing goes to waste. Be ruthlessly efficient._
Reject modernity, eat your friends. Eating another being is a return to the primal state of existence. Some societies see this as a sacred act, absorbing strength from the fallen. Others use it as a punishment for traitors. Some will even eat them alive, for greater effect.
Eating another being is not just for survival, it is to gain strength, and minimize waste. Nature leaves nothing to waste, so nor should we. The greatest crime is letting flesh rot unused.
