It seems like a point crawl would naturally evolve out of a hex crawl, as a kind of shorthand or fast travel, at least to already discovered lands. You finished the dungeon delve and decide to head back to town because the session is almost over. Fast travel back. It’s now a point crawl. If you combined both, the hex crawl exists to find new points and show how they exist in a space relative to old points, and show how they are connected, after which the point crawl is used.

So basically make everywhere the party has been into a Point crawl, and have approximate times it takes to travel between points. Party can fast travel between points, with less random encounters than normal.
