Star-Serpents are giant snakes, made from [[Reality]] They are created via solar flare, where a chunk of [[Sun]] rips itself away and swims off into the inky blackness of space, ready to do battle with the Void beasts that seek to unmake all that exists.

Because they are made of the Sun, they are themselves Hyperreal, allowing them to resist the corrosive unreality of the [[Void]]. This does however mean that they must stay a decent distance away from [[Sequoia]], lest their hypereality scour it of life as we know it.

While they do have eyes, mouth, and scales, their bright glow and iridescent colouring makes this hard to make out from the surface of [[Sequoia]].

Cool scene where a snake swooshes past the [[Outer Edge]] of the dish, briefly stabilising the unreality, everything becoming more real for a short time before slowly fading back into the weird drug trip that it usually is out there.

Also they sometimes shed their scales which fall onto the dish as Snakestones. People can absorb them to gain power, but this comes at a cost.

Followers of the [[The Cycle (Southern Pantheon)]] believe the Star Serpents to be reincarnations of their ancestors.
