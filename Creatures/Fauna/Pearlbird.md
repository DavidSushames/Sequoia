A bird that is known to hunt a specific burrowing creature, their large beaks catch lots of dirt and sand when they catch their prey.

They are largely harmless to people, however their stomachs are known for their filtering properties, if one is killed and their stomach opened, many balls of purified metal can be found in the stomach cavity.
They can even be farmed, by placing their food in metal rich soil, they can produce a great many balls. However this method causes great gastric distress to the bird, and typically shortens their lifespan.

Some sapients regard the act of killing the creatures as immoral or inefficient, as the balls can be found in the stool of the bird, and so long as not too much metal is introduced to their diet they can live long and comfortable lives. However, many prefer the quick and large profit of pure metals one gets from killing the bird, than the steady but small stream of metal that comes from keeping the bird alive.
