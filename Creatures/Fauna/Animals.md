Animals on [[Sequoia]] are twice as big (x8 as heavy) as they are on earth. We have elected to ignore the square cube law, sacrificing realism in favour of cool giant animals.
This makes the wilderness dangerous, as well as making domestication tricky.

Near the inner edge, you'll find giant reptiles. Dinosaurs, pterosaurs, mosasaurs, etc.
Near the outer edge, you'll find giant mammals/birds. Mammoth, smilodon, indricotherium, glyptodon, terror bird, etc.
