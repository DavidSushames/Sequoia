Quickcorals are fast growing corals that rely on sunlight. It doesn't do very well beyond ~10 meters deep. It grows faster and is lighter than regular coral, but isn't as strong. It will grow on [[Driftpods]] if given the opportunity, protecting the pod's delicate lining. If the pod bursts, the coral will sink to the ocean floor as a hollow shell, forming a natural home for fish and perhaps Hepyr.

[[Driftfleet|Driftfleets]] use quickcoral to attach driftpods together into one solid platform, upon which they build their cities. The coral is also a pretty decent building material, albeit having a curve due to the roundness of the pods. Hope you like round houses.
