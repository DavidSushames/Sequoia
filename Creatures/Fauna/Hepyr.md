Hepyr are aquatic animals with arms like an octopus and armoured shells. The shell has a similar diameter to a football, and the Hepyr make use of it by carving out or finding a crevice for themselves and then turning their backs on the outside world and tucking themselves into the crevice. The shell creates a kind of plug and protects the creature while it rests. The Hepyr inhabit warmer waters, in the more tropical/mediterranean regions, but they venture to colder waters to breed, because the young can overheat easily. The Hepyr are not domesticated but they have a mutually beneficial relationship with pockets of fisherpeople across (whichever part of the world this is. I need to look at the map), not unlike otters. The Hepyr help to herd fish towards the fishers, and in return the fishers toss some of the fish back, stunned and easy to catch. They live in loose social groups with little to no hierarchy needed as they avoid conflict and are more likely to leave than fight with each other.
