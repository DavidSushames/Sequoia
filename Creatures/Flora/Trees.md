THORN TREE:
This tree has poisonous spikes covering it. Creatures who touch it get poisoned. Dead creatures are absorbed by its roots.
It's also got fruit that taste awesome and are probably also drugs and/or aphrodisiacs. It's got shrikes that live in the tree that deal with bugs.

BLOOD TREE:
This tree has dark red sap that looks like blood. It reacts to danger by raising it's sap pressure, or maybe by circulating the sap inside its trunk at high speeds. This is referred to as the roar of the tree. When damaged, the high pressure will spray out hot sap onto the animal/lumberjack that caused the damage.

FLECHETTE PINE
A pine tree, but its needles are solid, heavy, and sharp. It drops them on anything moving underneath it. It's roots consume the dead body. Everyone hates this bastard tree.

SEA TREE
A thick layer of salt crystals surround a soft, jellylike interior. It absorbs seawater from the ocean, and crystallizes it into its shell in order to grow. The jelly is either a delicacy or a source of water, haven't decided yet.
