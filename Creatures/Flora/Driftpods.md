Driftpods are large aquatic plant that grows on the seabed. It grows large gas filled seed pods (like those kelp bubble things). Once the pods are large enough (2-3 meters), they detach from the plant and float up to the surface. Floating pods release seeds as they float around, carried by currents. Released seeds sink down to the ocean floor and hopefully take root if they find a good spot. Seed propagation thing. Driftpods can float indefinitely unless damaged.
A driftpod is large enough to support the weight of a man.
Driftpods are the building blocks of the [[Driftfleet]].
Drifpods have a symbiotic relationship with [[Quickcoral]]

Quickcoral is a fast growing coral that often grows on driftpods. It grows faster and is lighter than regular coral, but isn't as strong. Quickcoral is used to hold driftpods together when building a driftfleet.
