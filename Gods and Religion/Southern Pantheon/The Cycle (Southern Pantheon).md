A dualistic pantheon consisting of the sun, and the void beyond the stars.

The [[Sun]] is the beginning. It is life and light and warmth. Where all things originated. It gives life so you can live until you die and your body continues to feed into the cycle of life and death.

The [[Void]] beyond the rim of the world is the end. It is death and darkness and cold. Where all things will eventually cease to be. When the time is right the world will be consumed by the void.

It’s all about the cycle. Just as day turns to night and back again, and the seasons continue in order, all things die and feed new life. When the world ends a new one will take its place. But only when its time comes.

The star-snakes are the souls of the ancestors. When your body returns to the land and your spirit becomes one of the snakes in the night sky. They form the barrier between the world and the hungering void, protecting it until the time is right for it to be consumed.
