[[Sequoia]] has many gods.
There are 4 main pantheons, but there are also a bunch of loose ones that either weren't invited, didn't want to join, or have been kicked out. These are known as [[Rogue Gods]].

[[Triptych (Northern Pantheon)]]
[[Eastern Pantheon]]
[[The Cycle (Southern Pantheon)]]
[[Western Pantheon]]

The different pantheons have an agreement with each other. 
"Your clerics/paladins/zealots/whatever can channel your power just fine, but they can't convert anyone or build shrines or sow dissent while they're over here."
