She is called something like Thousand Needles In The Wind, and she is all birds. 

One of the dark gods of the [[Eastern Pantheon]], Thousand Needles exists within every bird.

If enough birds get together in one place, she can speak through them, their chirping amalgamating into a distorted voice, sort of like those MIDI file piano things where its just notes but it sounds like singing and you can make out the words. 

When enough birds coalesce (about 20 tons of bird), she takes physical form. 

Some believe that if you catch enough birds in cages, you will have captured the goddess, and you can free her in exchange for a wish.
