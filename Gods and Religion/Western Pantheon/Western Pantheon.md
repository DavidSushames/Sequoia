Animal totem gods/guides. Divided into the Orthodox and the Wild.
### **Orthodox:**
Ant: Architects/Farmers
Shark: Warriors/Sailors
Crow: Scholars/Merchants
Dog: Guards/Community Leaders
### **Wild:**
Spider: Artists/Assassins
Octopus: Craftsmen/Doctors
Eagle: Nobles/Hunters
Cat: Scouts/Entertainers

The distinction is definitely *not* one of Good vs Evil, or Light vs Dark.
Its more of a Community vs Independence.

The gods themselves each have their opposing rival (Ant vs Spider, Shark vs Octopus, etc.)
