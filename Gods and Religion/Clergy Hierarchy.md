This here be definitions of the positions in the various churches of the [[Gods]].

**Priests**: Stay in the church and do sermons and regular churchy stuff for the common folk. Maybe a minor healing spell or something idk.

**Clerics**: Go out into the world and spread the faith. They get miracles associated with their god.
Abilities: Heal, Buffs, Debuffs, Spells, Miracles.

**Paladins**: Holy Knights. Go out into the world and protect folks from bad guys. 
Abilities: Lay on Hands, Smite, Aura stuff.

**Zealots**: Fanatics. Go out and commits god-sanctioned violence upon enemies of the church. Abilities: Instead of dying, don't. Awesome combat avatar, like in the Kane Chronicles.

**Saints**: Posthumous title. Dead clerics/paladins/zealots who were so awesome at their job, the gods recognized it. Their remains are now Relics and probably have magical properties. There is one (1) [[Saint Rhea the Martyr|living saint]], who does not know why or how she is still alive after her canonization. She did get awesome saint powers out of it though.
