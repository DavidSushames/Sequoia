There be three goddesses who may or may not all be the same person.
## Maiden
Represents growth, change, and Spring. Will bring stuff to life because it's cool.
## Mother
Represents protection, nurture, and healing. Not afraid to throw hands if her charges are threatened.
## Crone
Represents knowledge, presence, and Winter. Will pull you in half with her long spindly fingers and deceptive strength.
