"The Challenger delights in it," Bonk replied. "The Challenger loves nothing more than to see us grow, and to grow in any way possible. The Culturist has taken the exo-school of thought to the extreme. In fact, he is the paragon of that entire clique: to steal from other cultures and races and adopt their virtues for our own. Why, it's someone like him that is half the reason we orcs have non-orc skills anyway."

It's most of the reason why you bastards have any culture," the blade-covered Legend added. "Without the outside, what are you?" He grunted with displeasure. "You're all just a bunch of mimics. You see how we act, you see what we do, you see how we dress, and you take from that. You take from that or you decide to fight against it. You don't have any culture otherwise. Your kind isn’t real.”

Bonk frowned at the man. "It's very reductive. I have my violence. That is culture.” The words were meant at least partly in jest, but the man just sneered.

"No, you are violence. It's a psychological flaw for you, not culture. You are just a copy of the Challenger, a copy of everyone you fight. And that's why I decided against picking up what the Challenger was putting down. I'm already a weapon, and I got no use for a bunch of weapons pretending to be people. You get me, creature?”

I am a person that has been honed into a weapon. You are a weapon pretending to be a person.
