Orcs have a love/hate relationship with [[The Struggle]]. They believe that the [[Gods]] do a big changeup every 500 years because they are bored, and want us to struggle more. If the Orcs cause the struggle, then the oncoming disaster will surely be less awful. 

The gods hate us. They want us to struggle and fight until we die. Why? They rely on us for faith, like giant bloody parasites. They could end all our problems in an instant, but they choose not to. Without hardship, without The Struggle, there's no reason for you pathetic creatures to reach out a hand for help. You pray to [[Triptych (Northern Pantheon)|The Maiden]] because if you don't, your crops will die and you'll starve. You honour [[The Cycle (Southern Pantheon)|The Cycle]] because if you don't, the world will be thrown off balance and all will be doomed. It's like the man said, 'There are no atheists in a foxhole'. That's how it fucking works, there's always a threat. Why do you think they keep fucking things up every 500 years? They need you to struggle, to suffer. 

[[The Struggle]] is no better. He wants us to fight and grow and die and inflict pain even more than the rest of them. We hate him. We hate him so fucking much, you would not believe.





"The Challenger delights in it," Bonk replied. "The Challenger loves nothing more than to see us grow, and to grow in any way possible. The Culturist has taken the exo-school of thought to the extreme. In fact, he is the paragon of that entire clique: to steal from other cultures and races and adopt their virtues for our own. Why, it's someone like him that is half the reason we orcs have non-orc skills anyway."

It's most of the reason why you bastards have any culture," the blade-covered Legend added. "Without the outside, what are you?" He grunted with displeasure. "You're all just a bunch of mimics. You see how we act, you see what we do, you see how we dress, and you take from that. You take from that or you decide to fight against it. You don't have any culture otherwise. Your kind isn’t real.”

Bonk frowned at the man. "It's very reductive. I have my violence. That is culture.” The words were meant at least partly in jest, but the man just sneered.

"No, you are violence. It's a psychological flaw for you, not culture. You are just a copy of the Challenger, a copy of everyone you fight. And that's why I decided against picking up what the Challenger was putting down. I'm already a weapon, and I got no use for a bunch of weapons pretending to be people. You get me, creature?”

I am a person that has been honed into a weapon. You are a weapon pretending to be a person.



If something is easy, then it is not art," Helix declared vehemently. "Easy is what cripples and withers a body. Easy slows the mind. Easy leaves you weak with fear. Pray not for easy, pray to be so powerful that the impossible seems merely a struggle to you
