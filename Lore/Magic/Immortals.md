There are many ways to reach immortality, but each one only works once. Anyone else who tries the same method either dies, mutates, or becomes a shit-tier servant of the original.
Nobody quite knows why this is. Maybe the world is patching the holes as they're being discovered.
Maybe the [[Gods]] were sick of [[The Flock|KU's]] little bastards running around and never dying, so they're only allowing one of each. 

There is one lich, one vampire, one death knight, one mummy, etc.

Lich: Trapped their soul in a box so it can't escape.

Death Knight: Bound their soul to their armour. No body anymore, just the armour.

Koschei: Trapped their death in a box so it can never claim them.

UNNAMED: Perfect control over the body. Manually keeping a body alive is really really hard. Remember to breathe, beat your heart, digest food, combat infection, filter urine, etc.
Its easier to go undead and not worry about all that.

Vampire: drinks living people's blood to stay "alive". Is a good guy tho.

Living Saint: Somehow came back from canonization. A god did it idk.

[[Phoenix]]: Rebirths itself.
