A god held in chains, a power never to be used, a secret forever kept. 

Why is the god chained? Betrayal? Enslaved? Farmed? 

What's the power? Blood? Hell? Souls? Plague? 

What's the secret? Probably about the history, or maybe the god itself.
Rebellion, and the secret is the inciting incident? 
Secret is that the god is chained? 

This land is one of prosperity. 
There's tons of crops and the land is lush with resources. The people are happy. 

In times before, there was the god of balance/karma/debts. They granted gifts to their people, but made it clear that there was always a price. A year of bountiful harvest would be followed by a year of ruined crops.
A day of good luck would be followed by one of terrible luck.

One day, something happened to make the god weak enough to be imprisoned. Holy war? Attacking kaiju? Got Julius Caesar'd by the entire senate?
Anyway.
Some people chained the god. Whether they were invaders, heretics, or capitalists, I don't know just yet. The people living here now don't know about the God's imprisonment.

Those in charge demanded tons of great things. Give us bountiful harvests! Give us good luck! Give us good weather! That kind of stuff.
For now, the land is incredibly prosperous. It has been like this for many years.
The people in charge know that their debt is immense, more than could ever be payed off, and only accrues more interest each day.
However, there can only be so much accumulated debt, before something snaps. When this happens, or if the god is ever released, the accumulated karma would wipe the country off the map.
The majority of the populace is blissfully unaware of the looming disaster.
