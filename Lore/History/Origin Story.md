The creation story, as told by the natives of the (WIP Continent). They are probably definitely wrong and also heretical.

---
In the beginning, before there was anything, there were four brothers. 
Their names were VOID, EARTH, FLESH, and SOUL. 

It was good, for a time. But there was nothing for the brothers to do.
VOID, the oldest brother, was content with the nothingness, as he liked the silence, but his three brothers grew bored.

And so, EARTH, the second oldest, created rocks. Rocks that would last, and bring structure into the nothing.
It was good, for a time. But the rocks didn't do anything, and so the three brothers grew bored again.
VOID found the rocks the brothers had left behind. He did not mind them too much, as their structure did not disturb his nothingness. Nevertheless, he cleaned them up, and made them into nothing.

And so, FLESH, the third oldest brother, created bodies. Bodies that could grow and decay, and bring growth and chaos into the nothing.
It was good, for a time. But the bodies eventually grew predictable. And so the three brothers grew bored again.
VOID found the bodies the brothers had discarded. He minded them a little, as their growth and chaos disturbed his nothingness a little. So he cleaned them up, making them into nothing.

And so SOUL, the youngest brother, created spirits. Spirits that could think for themselves.
It was good, for a time. But the spirits couldn't do that much. They could think, but had no bodies. And so the three brothers  grew bored again.
VOID found the spirits the brothers had discarded. He did not like them, as their thoughts were noisy and disturbed his nothingness. So he cleaned them up, making them into nothing.

SOUL, upon seeing the issue, made a plan with FLESH.
"Brother, I can put my spirits into your bodies, so that they can do more! It'll be fun, trust. Also it was my idea, so the bodies have to listen to the spirits, ok?"
FLESH, upon hearing this, thought it might be fun and indulged his younger brother.

And so, Creatures were created.
It was good, for a time. The creatures could move a little, and interact with each other, but other than that, they could only float there. There was no land for them to walk on, no rocks to interact with, no anything else. And so the three brothers grew bored again.


SOUL and FLESH went to their older brother EARTH.
"Brother," they said. "Make us some rocks for our creatures to do things with, so that they can do things! It'll be fun, trust."
EARTH, upon hearing this, though it might be fun and indulged his younger brothers. But he knew that his older brother VOID did not like the noise, so he made the rocks far above where VOID would stay.

And so the great dish, [[Sequoia]], was created.

It was good, for a time. The creatures could move around on the dish, and do all the cool things that creatures tend to do. The three brothers were delighted in the creatures, and made it so that they could make more of themselves. When a creature's body died, its spirit would float around for a while until SOUL found it and put it into another body, so that it could continue doing creaturely things.
During this time, EARTH had another good idea. He put special rocks inside the creatures, to give them greater protection, stature, and strength.
And so, Bones were created. 

During all this, VOID had grown tired. His brothers kept making things, disturbing his nothingness with their somethingness.
He did not mind the rocks. He could tolerate the bodies. But loose spirits? That was too much.
However, he loved his brothers, and knew they needed the enrichment, lest they grew bored again and created more horrible noisy things.

And so VOID decided to do something about it.
"Guys, I'm gonna be real with you." He said to his brothers. "You gotta stop with putting spirits everywhere. They're loud and annoying, and are triggering my tinnitus. You can keep them inside your creatures, that's fine, the bodies dampen the noise quite a bit. But I'm going to clean up any loose spirits I find floating around. I will pull them in and make them into nothing!"
And ever since that day, that is what he did. 

And that is why people's souls are drawn downwards into the void below and become nothing when they die, as well as why straying too close to the edge is a bad idea, kids. Now go home, I need to have a nap.
