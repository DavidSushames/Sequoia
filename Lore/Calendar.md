# Seasons
A season has 3 months, 15 weeks, and 90 days.

**Spring** has the months of Rainrise, Redtide, and Rainset.
Rainfall is common as the ice and snow from Winter melts and re-enters the water cycle as temperatures return to normal.  

**Summer** has the months of Sunrise, Highsummer, and Sunset.
Days lengthen, nights grow short, and temperatures rise as the sun rises higher in the sky, reaching its peak in mid Highsummer.

**Autumn** has the months of Stormrise, Reaping, and Stormset.
Storms are common as temperatures return to normal.

**Winter** has the months of Frostrise, Deadwinter, and Frostset.
Days shorten, nights grow long, and temperatures plummet as the sun sinks lower beneath the disk, completely disappearing in mid Deadwinter.

The world has a base temperature and length of day, which Spring and Autumn share the whole way through, only changing during Summer and Winter. It's magic stuff with the sun ok?
