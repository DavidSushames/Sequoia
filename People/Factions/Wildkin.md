These guys have a caste system. Also tattoos. Every member has at least three tattoos. One on their forehead for their own profession, and one under each eye (or maybe on the eyelid? oooo~) for the professions of their parents. They get more tattoos as they do great things for their culture.

They have no written history. Instead, shamans and wise-folk remember every great legend, hero, and villain.

Their shamans bind spells of transformation into the peoples' souls, instead of casting them directly. This must be done in the wintertime when movement is slow, otherwise the two could tear apart. 
Think of it like a spirit companion or like an incarnation of yourself, instead of like the pokemon that wizards have.
This change to the soul means that their bodies change as they consume food. 

Consuming raw meat will alter their body, gaining subtle features of the consumed animal.
They still appear mostly human, but with a few animalistic features.
An eagle's eyes, a serpent's fangs, a wolf's smell, a bear's strength, etc. 
However, this consumption of other identities frays at the soul. They lose track of themself, and eventually they will run into the wilds as a wild beast. Only be eating the raw meat of a person can they retain their humanity. 

The more raw meat/transformations you go through, the bigger you get. This is not only a size thing (caps out at 7-8ft), but a presence thing. You can *feel* it when a high level Wildkin walks past. Kinda like when they bad guy steps into the saloon, and everybody goes quiet. It's this invisible pressure.
