*"Until the last beat of the heart."*

The Red Law is an organisation of healers who will keep their patients alive, no matter the cost.

Their clinics are more fortress than hospital, their walls marked by everburning braziers and red banners. They are set up in places of death; battlefields, frozen wastelands, plague zones. 

The Red Law are known for their cleansing fires, and their massive mountain dogs; great beasts bred to carry medicine and supplies. 

Their healing is brutal and violent, but effective. Infection is burned away, weaknesses are excised, bones are broken to be set again, tissue is melted back together, the body is filled with poisons to trick it back to life. You will not be permitted to die. 
They do fortunately use anaesthetic; thrashing patients bleed more and are harder to operate on.

Their only concern is the sanctity of life, and have sworn oaths to do no harm. But do not mistake this for weakness, for their dogs are under no such oath.

Their banner is red, with a stylized white anatomical heart in the center.
