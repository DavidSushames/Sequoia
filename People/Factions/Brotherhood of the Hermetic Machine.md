The Brotherhood of the Hermetic Machine are rat fuck bastards. They smell bad and hate nature. And probably eat babies. 

Instead of holding the sensible, just, honourable, good hearted worldview of Magic vs Technology, they see history as an eternal conflict between beautiful, ingenious Artifice, and rampant, repugnant Nature. The world must be tamed and brought to heel, using any means possible.

They have a massive document that lists all the plants and animals in the world, and divides them into two groups: "Useful for humanity" and "Destroy on sight". 

They have armoured suits made of tech and magic. They are made by enslaving a spirit to power a suit of armour. To wear and pilot one of these giant suits, it has to bond with you. This requires the removal of all your skin. They'll remove all your skin, and if you're still alive 24 hours later, you get to enter the suit. If you die, then you clearly weren't worthy.
Once you're in a suit, you're in it for life. You'll only be removed when you die. For some reason, you'll refer to yourself as "we".
Sometimes, the armour will keep moving and talking long after the pilot is dead. It'll still be just as awful though.

90% of the suit's magic is aimed at keeping you alive.

These guys are so awful that it stops anyone else from using magitech, lest they be associated with these fuckers.
