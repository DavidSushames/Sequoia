The Church of Sun Everadiant can be rat fuck bastards. Their heartland is the [[Crater Continent]], where they rage a constant war against the horrors pouring out of the [[Chake Shadow]]

Instead of believing in the perpetual cycle/dichotomy of [[The Cycle (Southern Pantheon)]], they only recognise the [[Sun]] as a god, spurning the [[Void]] as a great enemy. (They are right.)

They have an inquisition that roots out evil wherever they find it. Yes, they are very good at dealing with [[Void Witches]], but at other times they're just kidnapping goth baddies.

There is a splinter faction who work with [Munchiekin's antivoid ladies], but others feel like they're bad and

They have special elite troops called Saintknights. Saintknights are 9ft tall suits of holy armour, capable of great destruction. Space marine type shit.

To create a Saintknight, you must take the remains of a [[Saints|Saint]] and cast them within a great suit of armour, quenching it in sacred oils. Next, priests must chant blessings over the armour nonstop for no shorter than a week, this must be done in shifts. The spirit of the saint will possess the suit, and can commune with is bearer. 
Bearers must be accepted by the saint before they can pilot it. Mech type shit.

Cool scene where the long dead saint gives their young bearer life advice. 

Cool scene where you find a long lost saintknight and it'll allow you as a pilot as long as you're trying to get it back to the church.
