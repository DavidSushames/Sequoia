Country/extremist sect of [[Western Pantheon]]. 
Yes, the divine animals (Ant/Spider/Shark/Octopus/Crow/Eagle/Dog/Cat) are gods, but so are regular ants/spiders/etc. Each one contains a tiny little spark of divinity, and must be treated with respect.
Killing one of the divine creatures is illegal, and subject to harsh punishment. Yes, even if the tiger was trying to eat you at the time. There's a little more leeway with ants, they're extremists, not idiots.

They believe that the human drive to distance ourselves from nature is a mistake. 
People should be more like animals. Lots of fur/bone décor. Cooking food is illegal, everything must be eaten raw. They're also totally definitely cannibals.

Writing is also banned in their society. When the world ends, it won't be because of wolves and ducks and mice got together and opened the door to something terrible. It will be because of People Who Wrote Shit Down. All knowledge is passed verbally.
Heck, they even have some rituals where *talking* isn't allowed. Also clothes. Everyone has to be naked. Only during those rituals though, this isn't a "the writer's barely disguised fetish" thing.

There is a special day where animals and people swap places. People hiss and growl and fight and rut in the streets. Animals walk on two legs, go into the houses and eat food from the cupboards. They will use the outhouse, and drink tea. They don't read the paper however, as writing isn't allowed here. Nobody knows why this happens. Questioning it too much is, of course, illegal.

They have bone weapons for killing magic things.
They have totems, war dances, rituals, shamans, that tribal type shit. You know the type.
Strong, savage warriors. Sort of like Spartans, Celts, and Vikings combined.
### Druids
There's a secret, even *more* fanatical subsect who are even more extreme with their views about nature. Forgo language, clothing, and tools entirely.
They live as wolves do. Everything you think this means is true.
Have a way to remove the soul from the body. Souls are what separates us from animals, so clearly they have to go. The lack of souls makes them big and strong. Very scary guys.
Will drop from a tree and murder you with a rock.
Will kill and eat you if you use language or clothing in their lands.
