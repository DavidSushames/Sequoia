The Industrialists were once the lower/working class proletariat of the [[Magocracy]]. Tired of the abuse and lack of advancement opportunity (only magic users can rule), news of a [[Eastern Continent|rich new land]] discovered to the east was the final straw that caused widespread strikes and mass exodus. They gathered their tools and left eastward.

They have a strong presence in the new world, but also hold territory in the same continent as the Magocracy.
Both sides are doing a thing where they're not technically at war, but are sponsoring bandits/terrorist organisations/cults, or maybe they were a rogue/splinter faction and were absolutely not acting with our blessing, sorry for your loss. It's all about plausible deniability. And weapons development.
