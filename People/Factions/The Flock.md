“When all hope is lost, when there is no direction, when there’s no light… We will be here for you, until the end of time. We will make you what you so desperately desire to be. A true being.”

This faction is not quite a faction, but a cult run by an immortal apostle who calls himself The Shepherd.

The cult operates on the belief that there was only one true god of this world, and the rest are but pale pretenders. Their god had many names: Great Anathema, Beast Tide, It That Rewards Savagery, but the most common one was Beast God KU. 
KU was a great beast of destruction. Its body was everchanging, forming rending claws and tearing fangs, crushing hooves and razor talons, coarse fur and sharp scales. Its body rippling as if a million beasts warred within the flesh.
KU’s mind was old yet young, running on both instinct and wisdom. They were something primal yet clever. Something hideous yet familiar. Something ancient yet timeless.
Ku was the first of the beasts.

Ku spat up creatures of true beings, things spawned in their own image. They bore Ku’s claws, Ku’s fangs, even their fur and scales. They were adept in everything they needed to be. They could hunt, reproduce, and live forever. As long as they stayed loyal to Ku, they had everything.
In Ku’s mind, they were perfect. The first and the last creatures to inhabit Sequoia.

The other gods of the pantheon’s found Ku to be nothing more but a disgrace. Ku was a revolting, hideous beast that needed to be ripped apart, bit by bit. The life Ku made was even more of a foul scourge to humanity. It was a cancer. They believed the creatures should be exterminated, their souls ripped from their very beings.
The pantheon desired to take every part of Ku and disperse them to every living creature equally. They thought it was only fair. No beings with a soul should be made of such horrors like these things.

*Ku gets torn apart by the gods to be made into new creatures*

The Shepherd is a devoted being of Ku who was blessed with a disguise, the skin of a sheep. He is also the last true remaining follower of Ku when they were once powerful and great. The last living record of Ku’s creations.
The skin masks his stench and features, giving off a more “innocent” appearance to those he finds on his travels with his flock. Not only does this skin hide him from humans, but also from the gods.

The Shepherd can ‘bless’ his followers with different features of Ku, but not all blessing are equal or “good”

The Shepherd holds the last piece/organ of Ku and only he knows of it
