The Silverbrand Company is a bastard fusion of Viking raiders, the East India Company, and the mafia.

These scary Northmen were doing the whole rape and pillage thing, when they realised (or were told? by whooo?) that if you just collect taxes instead of razing the village, you can keep on doing it. Why not throw in a bit of mob boss "protection fee" vibes in there as well. So we've got the east empire company but with beards/axes, and the vibe is more barbaric Norse than elegant British.

Rippling muscles, long braided hair, beards, axes, tattoos, runes, lots of silver ornamentation. 
And then they whip out those teeny tiny spectacles to check the ledgers.

High ranking Silverbrands are called Silvermanes, and either dip or braid their beards with silver.

*"Let me make it simple for you. If you pay the yearly fee, your town gets to join as a Silverbrand Associate. That means you service our vessels, get a 5% discount on any trades with us, and you won't be considered a valid candidate for 'resource acquisition.'*
*…Meaning we won't sack your town."*
