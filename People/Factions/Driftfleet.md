Driftfleets, often referred to as Gardens, are floating raft-cities, carried across the ocean by giant sails.
They are made by lashing together large floating plants called [[Driftpods]] to form a platform, and then building on top of them. Much of a Driftfleet's buildings are made of driftwood, bone, and the lightweight, fastgrowing [[Quickcoral]].

Driftfleets act as living, mobile coral reefs. Dense gardens of plants, vines, and coral sprout across their surface. Below, vast amounts of sealife nest between the driftpods, feeding on algae and fallen scraps.

It is a beautiful sight, but a rose is not without its thorns.

Every citizen carries a weapon and trains with it from a young age. 
Below the driftpods, hidden in the dark, lurks the driftfleet's deadly protectors.
Sea-monsters. Leviathans. Beasts of the deep. Something that follows the fleet, feeding off the reef.
If attacked, a driftfleet may chum the waters, attracting the beast to come and feed.

Many driftfleets are named after their monster. Driftfleet Makara, Driftfleet Ekhidna, and Driftfleet Charybdis are to name but a few.

The leader of the driftfleet is the Captain.
