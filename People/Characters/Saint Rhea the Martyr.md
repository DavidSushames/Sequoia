The Living Saint.
Saint Rhea is a very influential member of the Northern Clergy.
Like all saints, she has a pair of wings, but only she is alive enough to use them. (Saints are only depicted with wings, it's not like the corpse suddenly sprouts em after canonization.)
Not sure about the type of wings. Classic fluffy white angel wings? Black crow wings? Maybe it depends on what form she's in (maiden/mother/crone). Yeah she can change modes probably.

She gained sainthood by doing the whole "sacrifice yourself to save your comrades", only she didn't actually die.

 Regarding her "class" (cleric/paladin /zealot) and therefore powerset (spells/smites/battle avatar)... Cleric is probably the easiest, but I think Zealot is cooler.

She has short hair, heckin muscles, and is not afraid to punt someone if she has to.

Tldr: tomboy angel waifu.
