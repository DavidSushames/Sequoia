### History  
Long ago the island was bathed in heat, the God of the Mountain gave his bounty freely to all that lived here, but one day the [[Phoenix]] came and the God of the Mountain fell silent forever. Now the Ashscales live in his absence, battling the chill of death to maintain life on the island. However, legends tell of the Son of the Mountain, who will one day rise up and pour out bountiful heat upon the island once again.

Why did the Phoenix come and desolate the mountain? Nobody knows.
### Religion  
The Ashscales have a strong belief in the split of Static/Cold/Death and Dynamic/Hot/Life. This includes their artwork, where straight lines and angles are considered ‘Static’ whereas curves and spirals are considered ‘Dynamic’.

It is common to pair these together with certain things to balance out the forces. For instance, houses are very static, so they are often painted with swirling patterns and warm colors to keep them dynamic. Meanwhile heat lamps are very dynamic, so they are caged in straight lines and geometric shapes to keep them static.

Most Ashscales believe that it is their sacred duty to keep the mountain alive and under their care. While they do not prevent Lizardfolk from leaving the island, they are expected to one day return to their home. Many Lizardfolk who go out and see the world will come back and speak of warm paradises far from the mountain, cities with no need of heat lamps and days as hot as the mountains crater. However, even if these paradises exist, they are not for the Ashscales. They will not turn their back on their god.

Some Lizardfolk try to get the Ashscales to move from the island, stating that staying on the island is a death sentence. That the God of the Mountain is dead and there is no Son that will come to deliver the Ashscales from the cold. Such talk is considered blasphemy, and most Lizardfolk who do so are usually branded as Exiles and forced from the island, never to return.
### Romance  
The Ashscales are strange in that they have a gender system that is mostly divorced from biological sex. They split their numbers into two distinct categories based off of the religious opposites; Static and Dynamic.  
Static Ashscales are expected to stay in the village and help with building, crafting and taking care of children.  
Dynamic Ashscales are expected to go out and hunt/forage for food, battle the wilderness or find resources for the Statics to craft with.

While it is more common for Statics to be Male, and Dynamics to be Female, this is not a hard and fast rule. Indeed it is only true around 75% of the time.

Because of this, same-sex couples do appear in their culture. Because they cannot bear their own children, it is common for them to become a ‘nanny pair’ with a couple who has too many children to take care of on their own.

This has led to a misconception among foreigners that the Ashscales are polyamorous, as a scholar once wrote of an Ashscale male and his “three wives”. It was actually a heterosexual couple and a lesbian nanny pair helping them with their 5 children.

Furthermore, while same-sex marriage is completely fine in their eyes (a Male Static may marry a Male Dynamic) same-gender marriage is entirely disallowed (a Male Static may not marry a Female Static).
### Animals
**Rockrams:** Source of Rockwool, Mutton and Milk.
**Big Moths?** Would be thematically appropriate, but what purpose would they serve?
### Materials  
**Rockwool:** Insulating wool harvested from native rockrams. Used as their primary tailoring material.  
**Calescite:** Permanently hot mineral. Can only really be used if alloyed with another metal, otherwise is just a powder. Has been used to create Warm Clothing, Heat Lamps, Forge Fires and even used for weapons.
