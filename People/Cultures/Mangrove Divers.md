Deep in the mangrove forests, where the waters run black with silt and toxins, live the Mangrove Divers.
There is safety in the trees, but the only food and resources are found in the water.
But the water is too dangerous to swim in, due to it being toxic, or full of undead, or too deep.
So you gotta consume [[Revlis]], which makes your body forget that it's alive. Slows down your heart rate, lets you resist poisons, that kind of stuff. That lets you swim in the toxic waters.

They probably have some kind of bushido code idk
