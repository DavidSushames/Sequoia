Revlis, also known as corpsepearl and antisilver, is an organic material that grows inside the bodies of corporeal undead. 
It is shiny, reminiscent of  paua/abalone shell, or an oil slick.

When brought into contact with silver, it rapidly disintegrates, giving off heat and light. The silver is undamaged, but may tarnish.

When consumed, it slows down the metabolism to a ridiculous level. The heart beats twice per minute, and breath can be held for at least 15 minutes by an untrained person. 
The record for revlis-assisted breath holding is over an hour, held by one of the [[Mangrove Divers]].
