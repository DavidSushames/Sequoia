A metal that constantly emits heat, producing more heat the purer it is.
Extremely pure variants is used in forges to reach incredible temperatures, allowing incredible feats of blacksmithing. However this pure variant tends to be very unstable and can only be used in controlled circumstances.
The semi-pure variants are the most commonly used, and are the primary construction material among the isles for the heat lamps that dot the streets. The construction of these lamps is one of amazing artistry, as the constructors create unique geometrical patterns in each lamp as part of the isles culture.
The final impure variant is less used, but it can be woven into the fabric of cloaks. When combined with the insulating properties of [[Rockwool]], this creates a cloak that can keep the user warm even in the coldest of environments.

It is also commonly employed in weapons and traps for certain tribes, as the heat imparted by pure Calescite can often kill when simple force cannot.

Used by the [[Ashscales]].
