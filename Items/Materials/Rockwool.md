Insulating wool harvested from rockrams. Used as the primary tailoring material by the [[Ashscales]].
Very insulating. Can handle the heat from Impure and Semipure [[Calescite]], but not the Pure variant.

Keeps you warm *and* cool. The only downside is that it's very uncomfortable. The Ashscales can mostly handle it due to their tough scales, but the average person will get crazy chafing.
