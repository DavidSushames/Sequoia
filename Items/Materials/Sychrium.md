A mineral from the furthest edges of the [[Outer Edge]] where reality starts to break down. These rocks phase in and out of reality randomly. When refined this can be harnessed to a degree, allowing for things like invisibility or briefly passing through walls.
If you could really get a good control of the phasing you could essentially make summonable items out of it, like a blade that doesn't exist until you summon it.
