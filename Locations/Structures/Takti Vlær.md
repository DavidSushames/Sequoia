The English Hedgehog's magic school that makes you nocturnal. It's on an island, in a lake, on another island, on the end of the [[Northern Continent]]. Biome is desert, so that's probably part of the reason why you go nocturnal. 

Takti is the name of the school/academy/monastery, Vlær is the name of the island it's on. 
The names are combined when referring to the school, unless its in an informal context, like using a nickname.

There was this one mage who set it up and she was like ‘War! You all need to be trained for war and it will be very extremely strict! Also don’t you dare waste your time on other magics, it will only distract you!’ But that was like 500 years ago, and the new management are like ‘Yeah… we’re grateful she set this place up but she was also kinda mean. You can have some other magics on the side, as a treat.’
