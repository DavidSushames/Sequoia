The Inner edge of [[Sequoia]] is where you are close enough to the [[Sun]] that Reality is stronger than you are.
The opposite of what happens at the [[Outer Edge]]. Its not that you're dreaming, its that you *are* the dream.
The rules are different here.
You know how sunlight is good for you, but too much and your get sunburn and cancer and then fucking die? It's like that but with reality.

You find stuff like the [[Glasslands]] here.
