This sun has roots. It lies in the center of the hole in the middle of [[Sequoia]]

Its roots burrow through the earth, tunneling all the way out to the outside edge, giving much-needed heat and light to the depths of the underground.

Every so often, a [[Star-Serpents|Star-Serpent]] will push its way down a root, making its way to the outside edge.

The sun is [[Reality|Hyperreal]]; a font of higher reality that spreads out across the dish. This is why it hurts to look at the sun, your eyes can't process what they're seeing.
