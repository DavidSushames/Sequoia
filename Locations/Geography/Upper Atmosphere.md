There's a whole bunch of floating islands up here. They don't get between the [[Sun]] and [[Sequoia]], so they never cast shadows onto the dish. Maybe some of them drift low and cause eclipses once a year or something.

Anyway, theres all sorts of cool shit up here.

Terraria's floating islands.
Tinker's Construct floating slime island.

You'll need an airship (or wings) to get between the islands, as the distances are wide, and gravity still works.
Theres probably treasure hunters up here doing treasure huntin.

Anything that lives here can probably fly.
Dunno why it doesn't fall down tho. Gravity? Atmospheric pressure?
